"""Detect and report near-duplicate command capabilities (spec R9b / finding F14).

The problem
-----------
Some workflows expose the same capability twice. On a large multi-context workflow,
``ControlsMonitor/list_findings`` and ``Directory/search_control_findings`` answer the same
question. Other pairs are legitimate neighbours or opposites whose current seed lists do not
express the distinction strongly enough. Both shapes present as benchmark failures. The value
of this module is diagnostic honesty — showing what the classifier can and cannot separate so
the developer can merge, alias, knowingly accept, or improve the seeds for the pair.

This module only reports. It never changes what is trained, which labels exist, or what any
model predicts.

The operational definition
--------------------------
"Near-duplicate" is defined as a property of the *training data*, not of the two commands'
meanings, because the training data is the only thing the classifier ever sees:

    Two commands are near-duplicates when a classifier restricted to that pair, trained on
    their own utterances, cannot tell them apart.

Made concrete as **pairwise separability**: leave-one-out, balanced, nearest-centroid
accuracy over the two commands' utterances in TF-IDF space (`pairwise_separability`).

* Leave-one-out, because an utterance sitting inside its own centroid classifies itself.
* Balanced (the mean of the two per-command recalls), so the chance line is 0.5 regardless
  of how many utterances each command has.
* TF-IDF with document frequency computed across **all** commands in the workflow, so the
  vocabulary every command shares — "order", "my", "please", the workflow's own subject
  matter — is discounted automatically, and only genuinely distinguishing terms carry
  weight. This is what stops a workflow full of ``modify_pending_order_address`` /
  ``modify_pending_order_items`` / ``modify_pending_order_payment`` from producing a wall
  of false positives: those commands share their boilerplate and differ in exactly the
  terms IDF promotes.

A pair is reported as a **duplicate** when separability is at or below
`DEFAULT_DUPLICATE_SEPARABILITY` (0.5, the coin-flip line) and as **overlapping** when it
is at or below `DEFAULT_OVERLAP_SEPARABILITY` *and* centroid similarity is high enough to
make the overlap worth a developer's attention. Overlapping pairs are a lower-severity
observation, not a warning.

Two honest limitations, stated here because the alternative is a developer over-trusting
the output:

1. **This is a lexical instrument.** What it sees is vocabulary overlap weighted by how
   much each term narrows down the command. Synonymous *verbs* do not defeat it — the
   ``tests/duplicate_capability_workflow`` control pair says "list/pull/give" against
   "search/find/look/get" and still scores 0.00, because the terms that carry the weight
   are the shared domain nouns. What defeats it is a duplicate pair whose vocabulary is
   genuinely disjoint end to end: two commands that mean the same thing and share no
   distinctive term. Nothing lexical can see that, and for it you need
   `find_confusable_commands`, which asks the trained model.
2. **Leave-one-out is biased downward on small utterance sets**: removing an utterance
   from its own centroid shrinks self-similarity while the comparison centroid keeps all
   its mass. The 0.5 cut is therefore more permissive than a true chance line would be.
   The empirical headroom on the shipped retail workflow is reported in the R9b notes:
   its worst pair scores 0.600 against a 0.5 threshold.

The second instrument
---------------------
`find_confusable_commands` takes a ``predict_fn(utterance) -> ranked labels`` — the same
contract `heldout_evaluation` uses and exactly what ``CommandRouter.predict`` returns — and
measures how often each command's own utterances are routed to another command. That is the
"cluster label centroids" half of R9b, done through the model's decisions rather than its
weights: it needs no torch import here, it works with any model, and it reports the thing a
developer actually cares about (what the router does) rather than a distance in a space
nobody can inspect.
