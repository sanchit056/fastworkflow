"""App-supplied and domain-conditioned personas for synthetic generation (spec R9a / F12).

Why this module exists
----------------------
Synthetic training utterances are written by an LLM role-playing a persona drawn from
PersonaHub. The draw is uniform over the whole corpus and conditioned on nothing: a
retail workflow and an identity-governance workflow get the same population of
astrophysicists, sommeliers and marine biologists. Finding F12 records the consequence —
most sampled personas have no relationship to the vocabulary the application's users
actually employ.

This module lets an application say who its users are, in one of two ways:

* **Supply the personas.** Write ``personas.json`` in the workflow folder with a
  ``personas`` list. Those are used verbatim; PersonaHub is not consulted or downloaded.
* **Condition the draw.** Write ``personas.json`` with ``domain_keywords`` and no
  ``personas`` list. PersonaHub is filtered to rows mentioning those keywords, and the
  usual deterministic sample is taken from the survivors.

With no ``personas.json`` and no ``SYNTHETIC_UTTERANCE_GEN_PERSONA_FILE`` the behaviour is
byte-identical to before this module existed: a deterministic sample over the full
PersonaHub corpus, with row indices as persona ids. ``test_personas.py`` pins that
equivalence against ``generate_synthetic.select_persona_indices`` directly rather than
asserting it in prose.

What is NOT claimed
-------------------
That domain-conditioned personas improve intent detection. The spec calls this
"plausibly a larger generalisation lever than anything in the training loop" and F12
labels it a hypothesis. It has not been measured in this repository, and per §11 (M4) it
currently cannot be measured from a single paired run: the utterances come from a live
LLM, so two runs at the same ``TRAINING_SEED`` produce different training data (0/5
commands matched). This module makes the experiment *possible*. It does not report a
result, and nothing here should be read as one.

Persona id discipline
---------------------
Persona ids are load-bearing beyond provenance. ``heldout_evaluation.expand_persona_id``
parses them to recover the atomic personas behind a composite id, and the whole-persona
holdout (decision D1) depends on that parse being correct. An app-supplied id containing
``PERSONA_ID_SEPARATOR``, or colliding with ``SEED_PERSONA_ID`` or
``UNRESOLVED_PERSONA_PREFIX``, would silently corrupt the holdout into the data leak D1
exists to prevent. ``validate_persona_id`` rejects all three, loudly, at load time.
