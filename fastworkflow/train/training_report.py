"""Per-command training-data report and a minimum-row floor (spec R3b, bd fix-551.4).

What this exists to answer
--------------------------
"Which of my commands are starved?" — which, per finding F13, is the
highest-leverage question a workflow author can ask, because seed count is the
single largest measured input to routing accuracy. Before this module a training
run printed ``Generating utterances for context X, command Y ...`` with no count
and no verdict, tens of thousands of lines deep, and never validated that a
command ended up with a usable number of rows (F4).

Wave 1 (R3a, `fix-551.3`) fixed the *silent failure* underneath that: a
rate-limited command used to return ``[]`` and drop out of its context's
classifier entirely (F3); it now retries with backoff and degrades to
``[command_name] + seeds``. That makes the command weak instead of absent, and
records ``fell_back`` on its provenance. This module is the *visibility* half:
it turns those records into something a developer reads and acts on.

Where the numbers come from
---------------------------
Everything is derived from files already written under ``___command_info``. This
module computes nothing during training and never touches the training loop:

* ``training_provenance.json`` — one generation record per fully-qualified command,
  plus per-context labelled-row and explicit-skip records (written by
  `train.determinism.ProvenanceRecorder`).
* ``command_directory.json`` — ``core_command_names`` (which commands belong to
  the framework rather than to the developer). For legacy flat provenance only,
  ``input_for_param_extraction_class`` is the compatibility fallback for the explicit
  skip record that old training runs could not write.
* ``routing_definition.json`` — ``routing_definition_map``, i.e. which contexts
  each command is a label in.
* ``heldout_evaluation.json`` — optional. When R1's evaluation has run, its
  ``RoutingScore.per_command`` supplies the per-command held-out top-1 that R3b
  asks for. Absent, the column reads ``-``.

Reading from disk rather than from live objects is deliberate: the report is
available at the end of a training run and can be retained with its artifacts.

The two floors, and how much to trust them
------------------------------------------
See `DEFAULT_MIN_TRAINING_ROWS` and `DEFAULT_MIN_SEED_UTTERANCES`. One is derived
from a structural property of the training code; the other is an observation from
a single workflow. They are labelled differently in the output on purpose, and
only the structural floor can prevent publication.

`TrainingReport.has_blocking_problems` rejects structurally unusable data before
publication; fallback and seed-count findings remain advisory.
