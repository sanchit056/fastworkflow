"""Held-out evaluation for fastWorkflow intent models (R1a / R1b).

Why this module exists
----------------------
`model_pipeline_training.train()` reports a weighted F1 computed on
``train_test_split(dataset, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)`` — a random split of the
*same* synthetic utterance set the model trains on. Every utterance for one command comes
from a handful of personas expanding one seed list, so the 25% "test" rows are near
duplicates of the 75% "train" rows. That number measures memorisation. Measured gap on a
160-command workflow: ~0.94 reported F1 against 46.2% held-out top-1.

This module provides the missing held-out concept, on two axes that are deliberately
reported separately (decision D2 — they trade against each other and one blended score
hides the trade):

* **routing** — top-1 and in-list accuracy on phrasings the model did not train on.
* **escalation** — recall of the "this command lives upstairs" signal. A phrasing aimed at
  a command that is provably absent from the tested context's label space but present in
  one of its ancestors must produce a *confident, lone* escalation label, because only a
  lone escalation label makes the runtime walk the parent chain
  (``_commands/wildcard.py:100-104``). A escalation label buried in a top-k list takes the
  ambiguity branch instead and the signal is discarded (finding F7).

Two sources of held-out data are supported:

1. **Persona holdout** (`split_by_persona`) — whole personas are reserved, never a random
   sample of rows (decision D1). Holding out 25% of the rows of a persona whose other rows
   are in training is the defect, not the fix.
2. **A developer-supplied benchmark file** (`load_benchmark_file`) — hand-written
   phrasings, enforced disjoint from the seed table (`assert_benchmark_disjoint_from_seeds`).
   Without that enforcement a benchmark silently decays into a memorisation test the first
   time someone pastes a failing case into their seeds to "fix" it.

The module never loads a model. Scoring takes a caller-supplied
``predict_fn(utterance) -> list[str]`` returning the ranked candidate labels (top-1 first),
which is exactly what ``CommandRouter.predict`` returns. That keeps this module importable
and testable without torch.

The legacy in-distribution F1 is preserved on `HeldoutReport`, explicitly named
`in_distribution_f1`, so the number that has been quietly misleading people is still
available and no longer misread.
