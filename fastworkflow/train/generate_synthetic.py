"""LLM-written synthetic utterances for intent training (spec R2/R3/R6, F2/F3/F12).

What is digested into the utterance-cache key, and why
------------------------------------------------------
`utterance_fingerprint` hashes the SOURCE TEXT of every function that decides what
this command's generated utterances will be. `_DIGESTED_GENERATION_SOURCES` names
them, in two groups:

* **What the LLM is asked, and which answers survive** —
  `generate_utterances_for_personas` (it *is* the prompt) and `_is_template_echo`
  (it decides which returned rows become training rows).
* **WHICH personas do the asking** — `derived_seed`, `select_persona_indices`,
  `personas.resolve_personas` and `personas.PersonaSource.select`. The persona *ids*
  are deliberately absent from the key, because computing them would require the
  200k-row PersonaHub download the cache exists to avoid (decision D6). That makes
  the selection CODE the only thing standing between an edit to persona sampling and
  a cache full of entries written by personas a fresh run would no longer pick — so
  it has to be in here. Editing any of them invalidates every entry once, which is
  the intended cost.

One thing that decides who is asked is deliberately NOT in this tuple: the ACTIVE
SOURCE's own row-selection code (`DomainConditionedPersonaSource._matches` and
``rows``). It arrives through the ``persona_source`` fingerprint input instead, as the
third component of `personas.active_persona_source_label`. That input is already a
function of the installed source, so covering the source there costs nothing, whereas
naming those methods here would make every workflow in existence regenerate because a
keyword filter that only a workflow with a ``personas.json`` can reach was edited. See
`personas.pool_source_digest` (bd fix-6r5).

Nothing else in this module belongs in the key: the fallback and reporting helpers
run only when generation has already failed, and a fallen-back run is never cached.
