"""Selective retraining: deciding which contexts must be retrained when a command changes.

Retraining a single command is **not local**. "Only this command changed" is never
only one context, because two independent inheritance axes decide the blast radius:

``base`` — command inheritance, declared in ``_commands/context_inheritance_model.json``.
    ``CommandContextModel.commands(ctx)`` already merges every base context's commands
    into ``ctx``'s effective label space, so a changed command appears directly in the
    label space of every context that inherits it.

``parent`` — context ancestry, declared in ``context_hierarchy_model.json``.
    A context's ``wildcard`` class is assembled from its *ancestors'* utterances
    (see ``model_pipeline_training.cache_ancestor_utterances``). A command changing in
    context ``A`` therefore changes the *negative* class of every descendant of ``A``,
    even though none of those descendants list that command in their own label space.

The second axis is the one that makes naive per-command retraining wrong. It desyncs
wildcard classes across the hierarchy with no error, no exception, and no visible
symptom -- the models simply disagree about what "belongs upstairs".

The closure is computed once rather than iterated to a fixed point: a context that is
dirty *only* because its wildcard class changed has no changed commands of its own, so
it does not propagate dirtiness any further. ``get_ancestor_contexts`` already returns
the full transitive chain, so one pass covers arbitrarily deep hierarchies.

Why the closure alone is not enough
-----------------------------------
The command-level closure above answers "which contexts are affected by a command
whose *file* changed". It does not answer "is this context's model still the model
this workflow would produce today", and those are different questions. Three change
classes move a context's label space without any command file changing:

* an edit to ``_commands/context_inheritance_model.json`` (``base``) changes which
  commands a context carries, and therefore which commands reach the *wildcard*
  classes of that context's descendants -- with no command file touched anywhere;
* an edit to ``context_hierarchy_model.json`` (``parent``) changes whose utterances
  form a context's wildcard class, and can change whether ``WILDCARD_LABEL`` is a
  label in that context **at all**: the trainer drops the escalation class where
  ``ancestor_utterances - context_utterances`` is empty, so gaining or losing an
  ancestor can add or remove a class;
* a change to the reserved-label inputs themselves -- ``PARAMETER_VALUE_PLACEHOLDERS``
  is a code constant that is trained as a class in **every** context.

So this module records a full ``TrainingSignature`` alongside each artifact version
and refuses to carry a context forward unless that context's recorded signature is
*identical* to the one the workflow would produce now. The closure decides what is
definitely dirty; the signature comparison decides what is provably clean. A context
is carried forward only when both agree, plus a third check that its artifacts are
actually present and complete in the version being carried from.

Safe by construction
--------------------
Every path that cannot answer "this context is provably unchanged" retrains. There is
no branch anywhere below that skips a context on incomplete information: a missing
baseline, an unreadable file, an unknown context, an unhydratable command, a changed
global input, or an incomplete artifact directory all resolve to *retrain*. The cost
of a false retrain is time; the cost of a false skip is a silently stale model that
nothing in the package would detect (spec F1/F10 -- there is no signal that would
surface one). Those are not comparable, so the tie always breaks the same way.

Where the baseline lives, and why it is versioned
------------------------------------------------
The signature is written to ``versions/<id>/training_signature.json`` and the baseline
is read from whichever version is **current**. Storing it at the top level of
``___command_info`` instead would break internal recovery: moving the artifacts back
without their signature would leave a top-level signature describing
the newest train, so the next automatic incremental run would compare today's sources
against a baseline that does not describe the artifacts it is about to carry forward,
and would carry forward stale models while reporting "nothing changed". Versioning the
signature makes rollback self-consistent at no cost.
