"""Versioned training artifacts with a `current` pointer (spec R4, decision D8).

Before this module, `fastworkflow train` wrote per-context model artifacts directly
into `<workflow>/___command_info/<Context>/`. There was no version, no rollback, and
nothing marking those directories as expensive: comparing two training runs meant
moving 8.6 GB by hand, and an unrelated scaffold-regeneration step once destroyed a
complete trained set. Versioning is also the precondition for paired evaluation —
scoring two artifact sets on identical cases — which is the acceptance mechanism for
the wildcard work (R7) and the substrate for the convergence loop (R8).

Layout
------
    <workflow>/___command_info/
        command_directory.json          <- workflow-scoped, NOT versioned
        routing_definition.json         <- workflow-scoped, NOT versioned
        <command>_param_labeled.json    <- workflow-scoped, NOT versioned
        current.json                    <- authoritative pointer (this module)
        versions/
            README.md                   <- "these cost hours to rebuild" warning
            <version_id>/
                manifest.json
                global/{tinymodel.pth, largemodel.pth, threshold.json, ...}
                <Context>/...
        current    -> versions/<version_id>              (symlink, best effort)
        <Context>  -> versions/<version_id>/<Context>    (compatibility entry)
        global     -> versions/<version_id>/global       (compatibility entry)

Only the **per-context model directories** belong to a version. The two JSON
snapshots are build artifacts guarded by `source_fingerprint` and are rewritten
whenever a command source's mtime changes — i.e. by merely importing a workflow, not
by training. Versioning something that a read can rewrite would manufacture versions
on import. `is_workflow_trained` also reads `routing_definition.json` to *enumerate*
the contexts it then checks for, so it must be resolvable before any version is.
`<command>_param_labeled.json` files are kilobytes and are read at runtime from the
top level by `utils/signatures.py`; they stay put.

Why per-context compatibility entries
-------------------------------------
Every existing reader builds `<workflow>/___command_info/<Context>/...` — including
`intent_detection.py:39`, which builds it as a literal f-string. The compatibility
entries mean those readers keep working byte-for-byte unchanged while the real bytes
live under a version. They point **directly** at `versions/<id>/<Context>` rather
than hopping through `current`, so deleting or losing the `current` symlink cannot
break every context at once, and `os.path.realpath` on any context entry names the
version in one hop.

The pointer file `current.json` is the authoritative record of which version is
current, so the current version is discoverable even where symlinks are unavailable
or were clobbered. `publish_version` writes it *last*, after preparing every reader
path, so it is the publication commit point: any earlier failure leaves the
authoritative pointer on the old version. During that preparation window,
`prune_versions` also protects versions referenced by compatibility entries or the
convenience link.
