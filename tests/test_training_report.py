"""Integration tests for the per-command training-data report (spec R3b, bd fix-551.4).

Per `.cursor/rules/testing_rules.mdc` these are integration tests: no Mock fixtures
and no patching of fastWorkflow internals. Where a failure condition is needed it is
**induced** — real `litellm` exception objects raised by locally defined callables, a
locally defined persona source, a real `ProvenanceRecorder` saving a real file — so
nothing below needs an API key or the network except the end-to-end test, which skips
cleanly without one following the convention in `test_train_modern_stack.py`.

The build inputs are the *real* `command_directory.json` and `routing_definition.json`
from the bundled `fastworkflow/examples/hello_world`, copied into a tmp workflow, so
the tests exercise the field names the trainer actually writes rather than a
hand-written approximation of them.
