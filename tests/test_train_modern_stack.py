"""Regression test: `fastworkflow train` on the modern stack.

This exercises the full intent-detection training pipeline end-to-end on the
bundled ``hello_world`` example and asserts that:

1. Trained per-context model artifacts are produced under ``___command_info/``
   (``tinymodel.pth``/``largemodel.pth`` etc.), not just the build JSONs.
2. A representative utterance routes to the expected command.

It is designed to run under the modern stack (transformers 5.x, dspy 3.x,
openai 2.x). Producing model artifacts requires the optional ``datasets``
package AND a real synthetic-data-generation key, so the test skips cleanly
when those are unavailable (e.g. CI without secrets configured).
